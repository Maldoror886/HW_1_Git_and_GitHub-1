        Hello, I'm Liu Jiaxu, I'm a Chinese girl and I'm 22 years old.
    </h3>
    <h2>Major of study</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>University studies in journalism and communications</li>
        <li>Currently learning interactive media at fanshawe</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Interests</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Love making documentaries and often go to remote areas to document people's lives because I think there
            must
            be many hidden stories and marginalized groups in the border areas of a country. I want to discover them
            and
            document and share them on the internet (yes, I really like anthropology and sociology).</li>
        <li>Love to cook and study dark cuisine (strange foods âž• strange ways to do things) On my Facebook page, I
            share
            many delicious meals.
        </li>
        <li>Love movies and books, I'm a girl who watches two movies a week and reads three books a month.</li>
        <li>Love to travel, I once drove around by myself for a month, I love the joy I get from driving.
        </li>
